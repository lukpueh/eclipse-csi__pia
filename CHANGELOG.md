## [Unreleased]

### Added
* `pia verify` command: independent cross-check that the database matches the
  curated file, sharing none of the sync reconcile logic. Structural check is
  offline; `--check-resolution` re-verifies resolved GitHub owner ids and
  DependencyTrack parent uuids against their sources. Golden fixtures pin the
  verifier's projection to human-authored expected rows.
