"""Declarative sync of project authorizations from a curated file into the DB.

Reconciles the whole authorization state against a human-curated file (the single
source of truth): it creates new entries, updates changed ones, and deletes entries
that are no longer in the file.

The file is a list of Eclipse Foundation projects, each with a flat list of workload
URLs (GitHub repo or Jenkins instance URL — the type is inferred from the host) and a
single DependencyTrack project with its products. A Jenkins workload is listed as
its instance URL; PIA appends ``/oidc`` to derive the OIDC issuer:
